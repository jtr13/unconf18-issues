            <p>Rstudio is looking for Director of Education who can help with this project.

<p>How can we ensure that uptake of R is not limited by misconceptions like “R isn’t a real programming language” or “R can’t be used in production”?</p>
<p>But, why don&#39;t we, as a community of R users, work on a doc or blog post where the data scientists talk about their experience of using R for a lot of things than just statistics that can help remove this kind of a stigma that is being told to young and aspiring data scientists like me. In all honesty, when I started learning data science, the instructors were pretty harsh in their view about R without even knowing it&#39;s full capabilities.</p>
<p>Why can&#39;t we collaborate with an open-source business like RStudio and work with to help promote R for higher level programming?</p>

          <div class="body"><p>I like your idea. In crafting the writting, Would you consider ideas from behavioral psycology? That is not my field but I find it fascinating and potentially useful. </p>
<p>What most quickly comes to my mind are ideas from the book <a href="http://heathbrothers.com/books/switch/">Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard</a>, by the Heath brothers. The book presents a model to facilitate change that can be summarized in this image:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.joshuanhook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/elephant-030.png" alt=""> </p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct the rider: Provide convincing evidence for why to change. </li>
<li>Motivate the elephant: Make people <em>feel</em> they need to change.</li>
<li>Shape the path: Provide systems, workflows, convensions that facilitate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another idea that comes to my mind is about how to influence people. Here I&#39;m inspired by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034">How to win friends and influence people</a>, by Dale Carnegie, and a bunch of other books (<a href="http://bit.ly/share-wisdom">audible books including free-link</a>). I think the most influential way to drive change is by asking questions and listening. </p>
<p>I suggest creating a friendly forum, maybe a meetup, where &quot;speakers&quot; of different programming languagges solve the same problem. This should enrich everyone&#39;s hearts and minds, including R users.</p>
