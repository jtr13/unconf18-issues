            <p>Getting progress bars and other information in the console for big jobs running in parallel is something I&#39;ve wanted for a <em>looong</em> time. It is possible to get <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/03/creating-progress-bar-with-foreach-parallel-processing.html">GUI progress bars on windows</a> (using TK), but this method apparently doesn&#39;t work on mac/linux, and doesn&#39;t print to the console.</p>
<p>It would be awesome if this functionality could be integrated with the <a href="https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future">future</a> package, so that it can be used on any parallel backed the future API supports. It would be super awesome if we could enable export of the widely used progress bars in <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/txtProgressBar.html"><code>utils</code></a>, and the swanky progress bars in <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/progress"><code>progress</code></a>.</p>
<p>There are technical hurdles around with communication between processes and differences between operating systems, but it&#39;s definitely achievable. I&#39;ve put together a gist&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a prototype that does this the dumb (but generalisable) way; writing progress information to tempfiles which are read by the main process:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-r">library (future)
source(&quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/goldingn/d5a3aebfbc63eaadd92f0ff5ca811a5d/raw/12b552722020626e3f7014e1d9314266287acee0/parallel_progress.R&quot;)

foo &lt;- function (n) {
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    update_parallel_progress(i, n)
    Sys.sleep(runif(1))
  }
  &quot;success!&quot;
}

plan(multiprocess)
future_replicate(4, foo(30))
</code></pre>

<p>There are various ways this could be improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing progress bars rather than just a percentage process (preferably just embedding bars from the utils and progress packages).</li>
<li>Sending progress information from processes running on another file system (e.g. remote servers&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)</li>
<li>Handling more processes than threads</li>
<li>Handling sequential execution</li>
<li>Proper integration with the future package</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/issues/141">Re. progress information in <code>future</code></a> in which @HenrikBengtsson says he&#39;d rather it were a separate package, and suggests using <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/processx"><code>processx</code></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/r-lib/progress/issues/26">Re. multiple progress bars in progress</a> - having progress bars on separate lines isn&#39;t trivial since not all consoles allow overwriting of more than one line of output.</p>
<p>Heads up to @HenrikBengtsson and @gaborcsardi, in case they know of progress on this topic that I&#39;m not aware of!</p>

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; my main motivation for this is getting live console progress bars for <a href="https://greta-dev.github.io/greta">greta</a> jobs running on Google CloudML</p>

          <div class="body"><p>This is a really important issue for me as well, and I&#39;ve implemented the basis of the <code>RcppParallel</code> necessities too. This is also by &quot;dumb&quot; file dump, after spending  several days poring through loads of TBB code and finding no better idea. A merge of both R and C++ approaches would likely be really helpful. An <strong>R</strong> function for C++ code injection should also be possible because it&#39;s just appended to the end of an <code>RcppParallel::worker::operator</code> call.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>The <code>greta.live</code> reference above relates to producing live-streaming plots of an ongoing analysis (MCMC in this case, but it could be anything). That would require very similar functionality, in having a master process providing information to the users, from log files written by the subprocesses.</p>
<p>Writing this parallel progress bar code in a general way would make similar problems like that easily achievable.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>For same machine scenarios, the file dump works and may make the most sense for the prototyping phase. But in case you&#39;re not aware of these, here are the usual suspects for message passing between different threads/processes: </p>
<p>Threads: queue + mutex + condition variable (need to get the latter two from a cross platform threading library, or require C++11). This would work well for RcppParallel and shouldn&#39;t be much work.
Process on POSIX: pipe()
Process on Windows: anonymous pipe</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with these and want to learn more I&#39;m happy to elaborate in person next week. This project would really help Shiny&#39;s new integration with future/promises (though for Shiny we&#39;d want callbacks in the main process instead of console messages, so we can send the progress to the browser). As would communicating cancellation requests from the master to the workees.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>This is an excellent and important proposal.  Here are some of my thoughts:</p>
<p>I think of progress bars as a special type of <em>non-critical</em> information that is communicated between workers and master.  When implementing a framework for this, it is important to <a href="https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/issues/141#issuecomment-292659432">consider</a> a few things. For instance,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>some workers run on the (i) same machine, on (ii) machines on the local network, and some on (iii) external remote machines.  It could even be that we run on a mix of these.</p>
</li>
<li><p>communication may be done directly via pipes/connections, shared file systems, via databases, distributed message-passing frameworks (e.g. ZeroMQ), third-party services (e.g. Pushbullet, ...), etc.  <em>Zero, one, or more</em> of these communication strategies may be supported on the end user&#39;s system - <em>as developers we should never make hard assumptions on which ones are supported</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>for some workers, we may not be able to retrieve any information until they terminate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>communication may time out / fail, which is ok and should be accounted for. It is important that such failures do neither block nor break the parallel processing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>file updates on shared file systems are often delayed, e.g. it can take 5-30 seconds for a file update to be seen by other machines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>the software may run in multi-user, multi-process environments, which may result in port clashes (a port is already be occupied by another process).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since progress information is non-critical, it should also be optional, which the progress API should reflect/support.  In all cases, we have information about when a &quot;task&quot; begins (= 0% progress) and when it finished (= 100% progress).  Any additional updates on progress in-between 0% and 100% are optional and receiving them should be considered a &quot;bonus&quot;.  I think this helps to have in mind when designing a progress framework.  If we require that progress information to be available everywhere, or to always be querible, we will also limit what type of parallel/distributed backends we can use.</p>
<p>I believe that a progress API should be defined in a standalone package.  This package could implement some basic/common communication strategies, whereas other strategies may be implemented on top of this in other packages/backends.</p>
