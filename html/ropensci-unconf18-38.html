            <p>Recently in the Slack channel I semi jokingly suggested creating an app to run a cron job to scrape the incoming folder at CRAN in order to better understand empirically how long packages stay in each state and where they move to and potentially what the bottlenecks are and what the most common kinds of problems are (for example what kinds of Notes are most common and what operating system environments have the most failures and why).  Maybe the CRAN managers already know this, but maintainers don&#39;t seem to.  Ideally if we had the data we could use it to make suggestions about how to deal with bottle necks or to improve documentation to help people avoid problems or (my pet issue) improve the understandability of notes. </p>

          <div class="body"><p>I non-jokingly think it&#39;s a cool idea. It&#39;d also be cool to have a dashboard because currently to find where your package is you need to click in the subfolders right?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask, what is probably, a naive question. Is this something that we can work on <em>with</em> the folks at CRAN? This amounts to some sort of oversight of CRAN particularly if this took the form of a package. I fully understand the need for this. But I wonder if some communication with the folks at CRAN about this may useful in the long run. </p>
