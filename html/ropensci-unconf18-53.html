            <p>I am not sure if this topic was tackled from all sides but thought about sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>
When one runs a script, there could be a computationally heavy parts, but not all these parts require re-running. The inputs to these parts could be the same, the imported data might not have changed since the last time, etc.</p>
<p>In Rmarkdown, one can use caching in chunks to save some data importing. And in scripts one could write some conditions to control running some code.</p>
<p><strong>It would be more efficient if there&#39;s a simple way to detect changes and decide which parts to be re-run automatically</strong></p>
<p>So if there are available solutions for this, let me know. If not we might think about certain functions or settings to help with this.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Yes, I designed <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/drake"><code>drake</code></a> explicitly for this purpose. See <code>drake</code>&#39;s <a href="https://ropensci.github.io/drake/articles/drake.html">main example</a> for a proof of both concept and implementation.</p>
<p>It is so gratifying to see people independently discover the need for such a tool.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>As much as I like <strong>drake</strong>, I see a space for a solution here is a little more lightweight.  Almost all R build systems force users to refactor their code away from scripts to functions.  There are good reasons for this but it adds a lot of overhead for people who are working with scripts. </p>
<p>I think there could be a useful solution here wherein one does cacheing on an R script with a function like <code>source_cached()</code>.  In this solution, one would treat every line of code in the script like a <strong>knitr</strong> chunk.  Then one could either</p>
<ul>
<li>Hash and save the script&#39;s environment after every line (high storage), or</li>
<li>Hash every and save every object in the environment after every line (more overhead, less storage)</li>
</ul>
<p>One could probably use <code>storr::driver_envionment()</code> for fast in-session storage, or a regular on-disk storr.</p>
<p>This wouldn&#39;t be the most efficient solution but it would probably work very well for the case of a script that has gotten a bit unwieldy which someone is developing through interactive use.</p>
<p>Since this is meant to be a convenience tool, one would probably throw in an RStudio add-in, so one could run <code>source_cached()</code> on the current script with a hotkey.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>@noamross I think <code>source_cached()</code> is absolutely possible, maybe even straightforward, with <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/memoise"><code>memoise</code></a> + <a href="https://github.com/duncantl/codedepends"><code>CodeDepends</code></a>. And I agree, its bare simplicity would fill a niche.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>At one point, I thought maybe there could be an automatic way to turn an arbitrary R script into a <code>drake_plan()</code>, but this turns out to be extremely difficult to even think about.</p>
