            <p>R-Ladies has been enormously successful at promoting gender diversity within the R community, and bringing many new women (and their diverse perspectives) into the R community. Can we do something similar for the LGBTQ community?</p>
<p>There are some differences between the communities we&#39;d need to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The LGBTQ community is much smaller than the R-Ladies community; would the intersection of R and LGBTQ be large enough to sustain a vibrant community? </li>
<li>On that note, there are many LGBTQ allies in the R community; how could we incorporate allies into this community as well?</li>
<li>Are there existing LGBTQ communities for data science / machine learning? Perhaps we could form an R community there?</li>
<li>R-Ladies is already very welcoming to diverse participants generally; perhaps a program within R-Ladies would make the most sense.</li>
<li>How would LGBTQ participants best like to engage within such a community? Thinking here about private forums vs public forums, etc.</li>
<li>Other thoughts/issues? (Please suggest in the comments.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I propose we form a small group to discuss these issues and to make some recommendations for fostering an LGBTQ community as a part of the R community.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>As someone who is is part of the LGBTQ community and in the R community, this is worth thinking about. I&#39;ve often felt a bit compartmentalized in my academic career and my identity, and I would welcome any group supporting both.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Would love to join this discussion about the LGBTQ community (also including intersex/nonbinary people) and possibly also expanding it to talk about racial/ethnic minority groups as well. How might we talk about welcoming people to the R community who are not cis, hetero white males?</p>

          <div class="body"><p>I&#39;d love to join this discussion with open ears. Safe to say we&#39;d publish an rOpenSci blog post on this if someone / a group decides to write something up after the discussion. </p>
<p>For example, last year, this post by Shannon Ellis <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/06/23/community/">https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/06/23/community/</a> came out of this unconf17 issue that became a lunch time discussion <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17/issues/63">https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17/issues/63</a>.</p>
