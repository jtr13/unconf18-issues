            <p>At ROpenSci 2017, a team created the <a href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/miner">miner package</a> with R functions to control the Minecraft world. The goal was to provide a framework for young people to learn R, motivated by their desire to automate the construction of objects in Minecraft or to control the world in other way. An accompanying package, <a href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/craft">craft</a>, was also created with functions to implement some larger-scale projects (for example, an <code>elsify</code> function to give the player the power Elsa to freeze water behind their feet). A <a href="https://ropenscilabs.github.io/miner_book/">bookdown book</a> collected these projects into book form.</p>
<p>With a small team and another couple of days, we could get the <code>miner</code> package ready for CRAN, and add additional examples to <code>craft</code> and the book. Things we could work on include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the API, in particular making location functions more consistent, and using R vectors instead of separate x, z, y arguments</li>
<li>Making the server connection more robust (right now it tends to disconnect every few minutes)</li>
<li>Providing a cleaner interface to Minecraft block types</li>
<li>Creating an up-to-date Docker image for the Spigot server, and simplifying the installation process</li>
</ul>
<p>The Spigot/RaspberryJuice server is a bit limited too; there&#39;s no way to change the orientation of the player, for example. We might be able to explore other Minecraft APIs and see if they&#39;re more suitable for this project.</p>
