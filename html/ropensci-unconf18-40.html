            <p>rOpenSci maintains a <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat">drat</a> repository that is built nightly by Circle-CI (with the help of <a href="https://github.com/richfitz/drat.builder">drat.builder</a>) at <a href="http://packages.ropensci.org">http://packages.ropensci.org</a>.  At the moment the utility of this is somewhat minimal; it provides an alternative to <code>devtools::install_github()</code> an hosts some supplemental data packages too large for CRAN.</p>
<p>Maintaining a cran-like repo of development versions could be a lot more compelling if we explored some additional features.   I think some of these could also be seen as useful services / perks of for a maintainer having their package on-boarded. Ideally these would be implemented in modular tools other groups could adopt on ad-hoc basis as well.  What would you like to see?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>prebuilt binaries (Mac, Windows, even Linux?)  Could significantly reduce install times when downloading packages, possibly useful for CI setups too.   (I believe @jeroen has some thoughts here). </p>
</li>
<li><p>Nightly builds.  Particularly useful for packages that interact with an API that might introduce a breaking change.  Currently we do this already via Travis, but with so many rOpenSci packages that can back up Travis builds of packages under active development.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dashboard summaries: a convenient dashboard to see which rOpenSci packages are failing tests on what platform, how frequently they have been downloaded (from the drat/mini-cran, also from CRAN), GitHub issues, other information.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>security features.  Previous unconfs (@hrbrmstr and others) have brainstormed about what a secure package repository might look like, signed packages etc.  A working platform (with binaries too!) might give us an interesting platform to try out these ideas? </p>
</li>
<li><p>reverse dependency checks. particularly for packages in our ecosystem that depend on other rOpenSci packages. </p>
</li>
<li><p>... Other ideas?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Would love to see feedback / interest flushing out any of the above as well as suggestions for other related services you could imagine for such an rOpenSci central repository.  </p>
