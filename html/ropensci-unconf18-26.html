            <p>When I&#39;m writing tutorials or documentation or when I&#39;m teaching I often fall back on the same sample data sets over and over. At the same time, when I need something specific such as an ordered factor I have to search around to find one.  I try to stick to the base datasets.  I was thinking that it would be neat to have something (a package or a shiny app or a combination) that would let you search for a specific class of data structure (data frame, matrix, ts, dist, cube etc (there are a lot))  an also for specific variable types for those types that support multiple types. Maybe also experimental versus observational?  <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html">https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html</a>  has a list of the data sets, but the purpose of that archive is more to put them all into csv format in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>An added bonus would be to be able to make the api generic enough to search other packages but my initial goal would be the ones in datasets.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Cool idea! Trying to figure if I understand correctly. Do you mean something like:</p>
<pre><code>check_dataset(package = &quot;datasets&quot;)
# A tibble: 8 x 6
  Package  Item          Title                                                        Rows  Cols Class

1 datasets ability.cov   Ability and Intelligence Tests                                  6     8 list

8 datasets austres       Quarterly Time Series of the Number of Australian Residents    89     2 ts   
</code></pre><p>Then you narrow down if you are look for data.frame, list etc?. So a function that a) returns a tibble and b) accepts a package(s) as an argument?</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Cool, yes something similar to what @boshek has,  I started playing a bit just to see what the complications would be.  My basic idea would be to be able to </p>
<ol>
<li>Search for a data set of a particular type (e.g. data frame, ts, mts, matrix etc)</li>
<li>Be able to search (within data frames I guess) for presence of variables with specific classes.
So if you take a package name as an argument get all the information about the data into a tibble and then you&#39;d be able to say give me all the data frames with a factor.</li>
</ol>
<p>So this is just a quick script for making a data frame from the core data. I wanted to see what some of the complications would be and they are having spaces + extra words in the Item field and having multiple classes. </p>
<pre><code>dataset_list &lt;- data(package=&quot;datasets&quot;)
datasets_df &lt;- as.data.frame(dataset_list[[&quot;results&quot;]], stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
datasets_df$short &lt;- gsub( &quot; .*$&quot;, &quot;&quot;, datasets_df$Item )

for (i in 1:nrow(datasets_df)){
  dataset_name &lt;- get(datasets_df$short[i])
  # Get the first class name when there is more than one. 
  class_name &lt;- class(dataset_name)
  datasets_df$class[i] &lt;- class(dataset_name)[1]
  datasets_df$n_classes[i] &lt;- length(class(dataset_name))
}
</code></pre><p>And then something like the below to get the classes but the question would be how to organize the information to make it most useful.
For example maybe something like a set of logical variables: has_numeric, has_factor, has_logical, has_integer, has_character etc. </p>
<pre><code># Figure out what would work best for people in terms of searching
unlist(lapply(get(datasets_df$Item[i]), class))
</code></pre></div>

          <div class="body"><p>Love this idea.  Beyond class, it would be helpful to have information about the data types. Often I need several categorical variables, and while I do love the Titanic dataset, some more diversity would be a good thing.  When writing exams I searched through <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Sleuth3/Sleuth3.pdf">the Sleuth3 manual</a> for particular criteria but it was very time-consuming.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>@jtr13  That&#39;s what I mean by class. There are so few ordered factors! So actually it would be good to know the number of each type. E.g. 3 factors, 2 ordered factors,5 numeric.  I agree that it&#39;s the combinations that get really frustrating.  When you want a simple example  having  to convert types can be a distraction from the main lesson. </p>
<p>@noamross If packages documented like that it would be cool and we could definitely include in a dashboard.   We could at least provide a url for the description (although we can also try to scrape them).The other thing is packages that wrap APIs for accessing data. The main thing is to make it automated. </p>
<p>Then maybe if we have a sense of what is there that let&#39;s us think about what&#39;s missing. </p>

<p>One of the big issues for me in the base categorical data is that they have it formatted into table classes but I want my students to see them like they are a data frame meaning a more realistic s setting where there are variables of at least two types.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Cool idea! One thought might be that oftentimes, when I&#39;m looking for a teaching dataset, I&#39;m looking for the presence of variable relationships in the data, such as smoking status (categorical) vs. BMI (continuous). So could this be another way of classifying the datasets?</p>

<p>Is a concept but not that well coded (loops!! ) ... and it doesn&#39;t handle getting the variable types for tibbles but it does work for data frames.  I mean this is just a concept but if we have a bunch of people we could make it really nice and figure out what is useful.  </p>
