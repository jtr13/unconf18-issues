            <p>I have a wild and crazy idea for iterating on the <a href="https://ropensci.org/tags/rprofile/">.rprofile interview series</a> from last year. I&#39;d like to continue doing .rprofiles this year, and anyone/everyone is welcome to join me in interviewing or being interviewer: <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17/issues/64">unconf17 Issue</a></p>
<p>But I&#39;d also like to try something new. Possibly to be called <code>.Renviron Interviews</code>?</p>
<p>.Renviron Interviews focus less on personal career/life topics and more on personal workflows/demos. <strong><em>If you have a process or package or R-related life skill that you&#39;re highly opinionated about, I think it would make an awesome .Renviron piece.</em></strong> I&#39;m imagining the process would go something like: </p>
<ol>
<li>An interviewer and interviewee sit together in front of a computer.</li>
<li>They turn screen capture on.</li>
<li>They turn audio recording on.</li>
<li>The interviewee shows the interviewer how to do something or use something, using their favorite tools, workflow and opinionated development practices.</li>
<li>The interviewer asks questions about what&#39;s going on.</li>
<li>The interviewer transcribes and edits the audio into written form, and selectively chooses pieces of the recorded screen capture to edit into short GIFs.</li>
<li>The interviewee makes their own edits or suggestions.</li>
<li>You have an awesome .Renviron!</li>
</ol>
<p>This could be a disaster! I&#39;ve never tried it before! Does anyone want to participate? I&#39;d love to hear feedback or nominations for interviews you&#39;d like to see.</p>
<p>Props as always to @stefaniebutland for ideation and inspiration ü•á </p>

<p>I like this idea. I was instantly reminded of Hadley&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boKFxBniUH0">video</a> or sites like <a href="http://emacsrocks.com/">emacsrocks</a> or <a href="https://usesthis.com/">usethis</a>. üëç on transcribing to text and GIFs as a medium. Your idea is kind of a blend of these types of things which is great!</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Yes @amoeba - I was inspired by that video from Hadley and also <a href="https://youtu.be/evTuL-RcRpc">this one from Julia</a>. Resources like these are really cool, but they take a lot of planning and prep to put together - unless you&#39;re a super confident boss and can just rep &#39;em out. </p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping that the more laid back, <em>&#39;I know someone will edit the heck out of this&#39;</em> approach will lower the scariness-to-entry for some folks and inspire the creation of more content like this.</p>

.rprofile interviews are human interest pieces about members of our lovely R community
.Renviron interviews are a platform for showcasing opinionated workflows and use cases related to R</p>
<p>I&#39;m interested in facilitating both these kinds of interviews at the unconf. Get @ me if you&#39;d like to participate! - Kelly</p>

Maybe you can tell us how you manage to do so many things -- and so well --at the same time (relates to <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/60)">https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/60)</a>.</p>
