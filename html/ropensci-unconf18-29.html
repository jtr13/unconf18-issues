            <p>Lots of packages need caching. When things get complicated enough, packages may need to access their own eternal data to do their internal stuff. This means caching somewhere, somehow, in a form that is reliable and available. This costs money.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, I don&#39;t have any of that; okay, I can&#39;t do that package.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there it ends. How about considering applications to ROpenSci to (financially) support caching via some suitable provider? The <a href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/flipper"><code>flipper</code> package</a> is a case in point. This works at the moment because it only trawls the <code>CRAN_package_db</code>. We would like to extend this to all <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/26#issuecomment-382140279"><code>man/</code> directories</a>, all non-CRAN packages on github, and <a href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/flipper/issues/6">many potential other places</a>. This is impossible without some sorta cloudy caching scheme.</p>
<p>Any chance of ROpenSci having an application scheme whereby those with existing ROpenSci packages apply for access to a wee chunk of server space?</p>

          <div class="body"><p>I was literally just crafting a proposal for a caching process for <code>drake</code>! I think it&#39;s a slightly different use-case than what you are proposing here, but maybe we can combine forces and think of all the caching use-cases and needs.  (See #30 )</p>

          <div class="body"><p>When it comes to caching, I am a huge fan of @richfitz&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/richfitz/storr"><code>storr</code></a> package. It&#39;s a general key-value storr with an expanding variety of backends (&quot;drivers&quot;), including <code>storr_rds()</code> and <code>storr_dbi()</code>. Maybe a remote <code>storr</code> driver would help here? Related: <a href="http://richfitz.github.io/storr/articles/external.html">http://richfitz.github.io/storr/articles/external.html</a>.</p>
