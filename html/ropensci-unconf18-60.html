            <p>The great amount and quality of work that some people do seems impossible. Such people include @jennybc, @jimhester, @hadley, and many others from rOpenSci. What they achieve would not only take me a new brain, but also 10 lives, 60 marriages, and all of my mental health. What habits, strategies, and tools do they have and use?</p>
<p>In some countries kids learn time management skills early, at school. Not where I grew up, and likely now in too many other places. As an adult I learned some helpful strategies, but I continue to drift to bad habits and poor work-life balance. I would love to casually discuss this issue and learn from your experience.</p>
