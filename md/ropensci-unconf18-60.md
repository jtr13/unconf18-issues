The great amount and quality of work that some people do seems impossible. Such people include @jennybc, @jimhester, @hadley, and many others from rOpenSci. What they achieve would not only take me a new brain, but also 10 lives, 60 marriages, and all of my mental health. What habits, strategies, and tools do they have and use?

In some countries kids learn time management skills early, at school. Not where I grew up, and likely now in too many other places. As an adult I learned some helpful strategies, but I continue to drift to bad habits and poor work-life balance. I would love to casually discuss this issue and learn from your experience.
