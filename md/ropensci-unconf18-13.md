# [Create educational docs/blog for claims like “R can’t be used in production”!](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/13)

Rstudio is looking for Director of Education who can help with this project.

How can we ensure that uptake of R is not limited by misconceptions like “R isn’t a real programming language” or “R can’t be used in production”?

But, why don&#x27;t we, as a community of R users, work on a doc or blog post where the data scientists talk about their experience of using R for a lot of things than just statistics that can help remove this kind of a stigma that is being told to young and aspiring data scientists like me. In all honesty, when I started learning data science, the instructors were pretty harsh in their view about R without even knowing it&#x27;s full capabilities.

Why can&#x27;t we collaborate with an open-source business like RStudio and work with to help promote R for higher level programming?

I like your idea. In crafting the writting, Would you consider ideas from behavioral psycology? That is not my field but I find it fascinating and potentially useful. 

What most quickly comes to my mind are ideas from the book [Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard](http://heathbrothers.com/books/switch/), by the Heath brothers. The book presents a model to facilitate change that can be summarized in this image:

Examples:
* Direct the rider: Provide convincing evidence for why to change. 
* Motivate the elephant: Make people _feel_ they need to change.
* Shape the path: Provide systems, workflows, convensions that facilitate change.

Another idea that comes to my mind is about how to influence people. Here I&#x27;m inspired by [How to win friends and influence people](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034), by Dale Carnegie, and a bunch of other books ([audible books including free-link](http://bit.ly/share-wisdom)). I think the most influential way to drive change is by asking questions and listening. 

I suggest creating a friendly forum, maybe a meetup, where &quot;speakers&quot; of different programming languagges solve the same problem. This should enrich everyone&#x27;s hearts and minds, including R users.
