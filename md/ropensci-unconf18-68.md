# [R package wrapper to the CEDAR API](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/68)

I know there will be a number of metadata nerds in attendance, this one&#x27;s for you ðŸ˜€ 

[CEDAR](https://metadatacenter.org/) provides tools for capturing metadata through templates and forms that can reduce the pain and error-prone-ness of typical metadata generation. I&#x27;m proposing an R package wrapper to the [CEDAR API](https://resource.metadatacenter.org/api/). Should be a pretty straightforward project that we could do in two days (or at least make good headway).

I&#x27;ve been in touch with the program manager from CEDAR in the past and they seemed excited about community collaborations. As far as I know, no one has been working on a CEDAR R package yet.
