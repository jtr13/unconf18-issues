# [Testing and reporting performance regressions / tracking performance over time](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/66)

There were two issues last year https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17/issues/90, https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17/issues/56 devoted to a service which would allow package authors to track performance of their package over time.

I think this is still an unmet need, maybe it would not be too much work to create a web service to do the storage and reporting for this with [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/)?
