# [GitHubBerries: get notified of new release of r package not on CRAN](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/77)

Inspired by CranBerries and new ropensci pkgs I am imagining a way to get notified about new releases of r packages on GitHub ( not yet on cran or never will be on cran.) there is a growing number of such packages. 

- get notified of selected packages
- Twitter not for new release of &quot;significant&quot; packages (based on stars/forks/ commits) ??

I imagine this is easiest if package has Travis CI but should be possible otherwise with GitHub API

There used to be a service called Sibbel sending you notifications of releases of repos one had starred but it shut down. Maybe there are equivalents out there?
