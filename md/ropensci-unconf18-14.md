I would be very interested in a brief tutorial or demo by @jimhester or @kevinushey in debugging a C problem without &#x60;printf()&#x60;. Preferably on both MacOS and Windows. cc @jennybc.

Windows is a bit of a pain, but I have managed to do it before so could probably get it working again to demo

I&#x27;d like to see @jimhester&#x27;s debugging workflow too :-)

I could try to prepare something worth showing. One of the nice things about R on Windows being built with MinGW is that the bundled &#x60;gdb.exe&#x60; seems to work well when attached to R.

You better share some of that sweet synergy @jimhester :)

Not to spoil anything too much ;), but does the workflow have a call to &#x60;R -d gdb&#x60; somewhere along the way?

I would like to see @jimhester&#x27;s debugging magic as well
