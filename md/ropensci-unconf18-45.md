Hello fellow Excel jockeys, metadata journalists, and SPSS licensees,

Just like last year (https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17/issues/84) I set up a little app to help you browse proposed projects: https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/runconf18-app/. If there are other features you want to see in the app let me know on the [project repo](https://github.com/seankross/runconf17-app) or better yet send me a pull request!

@seankross we&#x27;ve now added labels to issues and they come with emojis. ðŸ’ƒ  @noamross made me notice the emojis are rendered as text, not emojis, in your app. Do you think this could be solved easily? No worry if not, of course.
