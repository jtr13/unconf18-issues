This is a fork of #37 

Develop tools to help R code reviewers better understand the code they are reviewing and make the process easier and more robust, especially for new reviewers.

Expand on or consolidate https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pkgreviewr, https://github.com/lockedata/PackageReviewR, and https://github.com/noamross/launchboat

I note that, for non-R package code, there are also guides and tools from last year&#x27;s **checker** unconf project: https://github.com/ropenscilabs/checkers
