# [Write answers to common questions that R users ask about R packages](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/55)

I propose to write answers to the commonly asked questions about R packages, targetting specifically an imaginary R user with no background. 

This issue is motivated by the discussion with comments by @jennybc and @batpigandme ([thread](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/951493844687663104)). A draft is [here](https://github.com/maurolepore/pkg6w). I would love some help to finish it. Major edits are welcome and I&#x27;m happy to move the article wherever.
