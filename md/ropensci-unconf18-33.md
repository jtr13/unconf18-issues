# [Finally build out the Security CRAN Task View](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/33)

I started a repo but time is an enemy. A cpl of days in the Evergreen City could end up. @davidski had a stellar idea to use rOpenSci Unconf 2018 as a potential place to get&#x27;er done and I&#x27;ll gladly lead the way to do this.

It won&#x27;t take both days and folks can likely be involved in other projects before/during/after this one.

Can you give some examples of what you&#x27;d include?

Cool idea! When starting my inventory of rOpenSci packages to improve the categories of our registries I identified these rOpenSci packages as &quot;security&quot; related
https://github.com/ropensci/acme
https://github.com/ropensci/cyphr
https://github.com/ropensci/agent

Sure @elinw! I think of it as a pretty broad category since it wld have bits in it for working with various data format, metadata for data format, encryption, web scraping, getting metadata for IP addresses, domains &amp; urls. Plus building security tools, getting metadata from sites like Twitter/Facebook; API interfaces to security and security metadata services, etc.

NOTE: The above is far from comprehensive but shld help give an idea of the pkg diversity.
