# [Input text through Google Doc and display compiled Rmd](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/73)

## Summary for one of the projects that came up while discussing #42  

The objective is to write body text (as well as captions, etc.), in the google doc with very easy, flexible, and robust markup, and then import that information into a compiled document and mix it with code-generated outputs. [rchie](https://github.com/ropensci/rchie) parses [ArchieML](http://archieml.org/) for the purpose of pulling text written in Google Docs into R and uses it to build R markdown docs where the text came from Google Docs. The project consists on further advancing this - more details [here](https://github.com/noamross/rmd-rant#strategy-2-having-collaborators-provide-input-text-only).
